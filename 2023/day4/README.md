# Advent of Code Day 4 Challenge 2023

## Overview
This repository holds the Python solution for the Advent of Code Day 4 Challenge 2023, titled "Scratchcards." The challenge involves a unique puzzle where you have to analyze scratchcards to calculate their points and the total number of scratchcards won according to specific rules.

## Challenge Summary
The challenge is set in a fictional world where you help an Elf figure out the value of a pile of scratchcards. Each scratchcard contains a list of winning numbers and your numbers, separated by a vertical bar. The task is to:

- **Part 1**: Determine the point value of each card based on the number of matching numbers and calculate the total points for all scratchcards.
- **Part 2**: Discover the total number of scratchcards you end up with after winning additional scratchcards based on matching numbers.

## Solution
The provided Python script offers solutions for both parts:

- **Part 1**: It calculates the points for each scratchcard based on matching numbers and sums up the total points.
- **Part 2**: It processes the original and additional scratchcards won, calculating the total number of scratchcards.

## Key Features
- Parsing and processing scratchcard data from an input file.
- Calculating points for scratchcards based on matching numbers.
- Implementing a method to determine additional scratchcards won and summing them up.
- Efficient use of data structures and algorithms for optimal performance.
- Comprehensive documentation and annotations for readability and maintenance.

## Usage
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
- Place the input file 'day4_input.txt' in the same directory as the script. This file should contain the scratchcard data.
- Execute the script with `python3 [script_name].py`.

## Dependencies
The script solely relies on Python's standard library.
