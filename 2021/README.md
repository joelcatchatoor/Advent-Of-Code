Advent Of Code 2021
===================

Personal repo for 2021 Advent of Code. 

Solutions are written in Python, with a template inspired by https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/ (accessed 4th December 2021).

- Input data is read from a text file (included in the repo)
- Solutions are tested first with Advent Of Code example data (also included in the repo)
- Code is documented with comments
- Original code solutions are MVPs based on curiosity, with minimal code optimisation ("If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter")
